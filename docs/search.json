    "text": "I am a mathematics graduate passionate about data science in general and deep learning in particular. I love to learn new things and grow. I’ve spent the last 3 years growing as a developer through experience and education.\nI prefer to think of myself as an open-minded, down-to-earth, and outgoing person. I care very much for people whom I come across in my life and try to make their lives easier I love nature as well, this is why I like to go on camping, hiking, and all sorts of adventure activities.\nI also like to read about anthropology, psychology, and history to know how we all grow and why we are what we are. I am not sure if it’s true but I like to think that whatever we do has a reason most of the time we are not aware of our activities and thoughts but it always has a reason.\nI am currently working as a Web Developer at Accenture Solution and solving machine learning problems in my free time."
