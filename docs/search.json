    "section": "Perceptron",
    "text": "Perceptron\nA Perceptron is one of the simplese ANN architectures, invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt.\n\nA perceptron works similar to a biological neuron. A biological neuron receives electrical signals from its dendriles, modulates the electrical signals in various amounts, and then fires an output signal through its synapses only when the total strength of the input signals exceeds a certain threshold. The output is then fed to another neuron, and so forth.\n\n\nTo model the biological phenomenon, the artificial neuron performs two consecutive functions: it calculates the weighted sum of the inputs to represent the totgal strength of the input signals, and it applies a step function to the result to determine whether to fire the ourput 1 if the signal exceeds a certain threshold of 0 if the signal doesn’t exceed the threshold.\n\n\nHow Peceptron Works?\nThe perceptron’s learning logic goes like this:\n\nThe neuron calculate the weighted sum and applies the activation function to make a prediction y^. This is called the feedforward process:\n\n\\[y\\hat{} =  activation\\left(\\sum\\nolimits x_i \\cdot w_i + b\\right)\\]\n\nIt compares the output prediction with the correct label to calculate the error:\n\n\\[error = y-y\\hat{}\\]\n\nIt then update the weight. If the prediction is too high, it adjust the weight to make a lower prediction the next time, and vice versa.\nRepeat!\n\nHere’s how a since perceptron works to classify two classes :\n\nDrawback of perceptron. Sometimes its not possible to get desired result with only perceptron. In the below example you can see the model in not able to draw a line to classify the data(linearly inseperable data)\n\nIndroduction of ANN If you increase the number of neuron then you cann see model works pretty well.

Avoid materials that are too difficult or too easy, as they may not challenge you enough or may not provide enough value.\nSet a purpose: Before you start reading, ask yourself what you hope to get out of the material. This will help you focus and stay on track as you read.\nPreview the material: Before you start reading, take a few minutes to scan the material and get an overview. Look for headings, subheadings, and highlighted words or phrases. This will give you a sense of what the material is about and help you focus on the most important points.\nTake effective notes: As you read, take notes in a way that helps you understand and remember the material. Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize your notes, and try to use your own words as much as possible. Avoid copying large chunks of text, as this can be overwhelming and may not help you internalize the information.\nReview your notes: After you finish reading, take some time to review your notes.
