I am a mathematics graduate passionate about data science in general and deep learning in particular. I love to learn new things and grow. I’ve spent the last 3 years growing as a developer through experience and education.

I prefer to think of myself as an open-minded, down-to-earth, and outgoing person. I care very much for people whom I come across in my life and try to make their lives easier I love nature as well, this is why I like to go on camping, hiking, and all sorts of adventure activities.

I also like to read about anthropology, psychology, and history to know how we all grow and why we are what we are. I am not sure if it’s true but I like to think that whatever we do has a reason most of the time we are not aware of our activities and thoughts but it always has a reason.

I am currently working as a Web Developer at Accenture Solution and solving machine learning problems in my free time.
